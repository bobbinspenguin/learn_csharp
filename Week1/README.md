# Week 1: Introduction to C# and .NET

## Day 1: Setting Up the Environment

### Learning Objectives
- Install Visual Studio Community Edition
- Understand the Visual Studio interface and features
- Create and run your first C# console application

### Resources
- [Visual Studio Community Download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
- [Visual Studio Installation Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio)
- [Getting Started with Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/quickstart-aspnet-core)

### Hands-on Tasks
1. Install Visual Studio Community Edition with the following workloads:
   - .NET desktop development
   - ASP.NET and web development
   - Azure development
   - .NET Core cross-platform development

2. Create your first console application:
   - Open Visual Studio
   - Create a new project (File > New > Project)
   - Select "Console App (.NET Core)" or "Console App (.NET)"
   - Name it "HelloWorld"
   - Modify the Program.cs file to display a personalized greeting
   - Run the application (F5)

## Day 2: Basic C# Syntax

### Learning Objectives
- Understand C# syntax fundamentals
- Learn about variables, data types, and operators
- Practice control flow statements (if, switch, loops)

### Resources
- [C# Programming Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/)
- [C# Variables and Data Types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/)
- [C# Operators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/)

### Hands-on Tasks

1. Variables and Data Types Exercise:
   - Create a new console application named "BasicSyntaxPractice"
   - Declare variables of different types (int, string, bool, double, etc.)
   - Perform operations on these variables and display results

2. Control Flow Exercise:
   - Create a simple calculator that:
     - Takes two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /) as input
     - Uses if/else or switch statements to perform the chosen operation
     - Handles division by zero

3. Loops Exercise:
   - Create a program that:
     - Asks the user for a number
     - Prints the multiplication table for that number using a for loop
     - Uses a while loop to find the sum of numbers from 1 to n
     - Implements a do-while loop to validate user input

### Code Samples

You'll find the following examples in the subdirectories:
- `HelloWorld/`: Your first C# console application
- `BasicSyntaxPractice/`: Examples of variables, operators, and control flow
- `LoopsExercise/`: Various loop implementations

### Reflection Questions
1. What similarities and differences do you notice between C# and languages you're familiar with?
2. What aspects of the Visual Studio IDE do you find most useful?
3. What challenges did you face when implementing control flow statements?
