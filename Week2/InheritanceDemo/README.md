# Inheritance Demo

This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of inheritance and polymorphism in C#.

## Concepts Covered

- **Inheritance**: Student and Teacher classes inherit from Person base class
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields with public properties and validation
- **Polymorphism**: Method overriding and virtual methods
- **Base class constructor calls**: Using `base()` to call parent constructor

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Run `dotnet run` to execute the program
3. Observe how the same method calls produce different behaviors based on the actual object type

## Key Learning Points

- How derived classes can extend base class functionality
- The difference between overriding virtual methods and hiding methods
- How polymorphism allows treating different types uniformly
- Proper use of access modifiers and encapsulation
