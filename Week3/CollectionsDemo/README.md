# Collections and Generics Demo

This project demonstrates various collection types and generic programming concepts in C#.

## Concepts Covered

### Collection Types
- **Arrays**: Fixed-size collections
- **List<T>**: Dynamic arrays with rich functionality
- **Dictionary<TKey, TValue>**: Key-value pair collections
- **HashSet<T>**: Unique element collections with set operations
- **Queue<T>**: FIFO (First In, First Out) collections
- **Stack<T>**: LIFO (Last In, First Out) collections

### Generics
- **Generic Classes**: Creating reusable classes with type parameters
- **Generic Methods**: Methods that work with multiple types
- **Type Constraints**: Restricting generic types with `where` clause
- **Benefits**: Type safety, performance, code reuse

## Key Features Demonstrated

1. **Collection Operations**: Add, remove, search, iterate
2. **Set Operations**: Union, intersection, difference
3. **Generic Constraints**: Using `IComparable<T>` for type safety
4. **Custom Generic Classes**: Building your own generic collections
5. **Complex Collections**: Working with collections of custom objects

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Run `dotnet run` to execute the program
3. Choose from the interactive menu to explore different collection types
4. Each demo shows practical usage scenarios

## Learning Objectives

- Understand when to use different collection types
- Learn the benefits of generics over non-generic collections
- Practice with real-world collection manipulation scenarios
- See how generics provide type safety and performance benefits
