# Week 7: Security and Advanced API Features

## Day 1: Authentication and Authorization

### Learning Objectives

- Understand authentication and authorization concepts
- Learn how to secure APIs with tokens and OAuth
- Implement user management in .NET applications

### Resources

- [Authentication in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/)
- [JWT Authentication in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/jwt-authn)
- [Identity in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity)
- [OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow)

### Hands-on Tasks

1. JWT Authentication:
   - Create an API that:
     - Implements JWT token-based authentication
     - Has user registration and login endpoints
     - Secures specific endpoints with authorization
     - Handles token validation and refresh

2. Identity Implementation:
   - Create a project that:
     - Uses ASP.NET Core Identity for user management
     - Implements role-based authorization
     - Handles user profiles and claims
     - Provides proper password policies and account management

3. OAuth Integration:
   - Create an application that:
     - Integrates with external OAuth providers (e.g., Microsoft, Google)
     - Handles OAuth flows properly
     - Manages user information from external providers
     - Implements proper state management and security

## Day 2: Advanced API Concepts

### Learning Objectives

- Learn about API versioning and documentation
- Understand dependency injection and its benefits
- Implement advanced error handling and logging

### Resources

- [API Versioning in ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/Microsoft/aspnet-api-versioning)
- [Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/web-api-help-pages-using-swagger)
- [Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection)
- [Logging in .NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/)

### Hands-on Tasks

1. API Versioning and Documentation:
   - Create an API that:
     - Implements proper versioning (URL, header, or query parameter-based)
     - Uses Swagger/OpenAPI for documentation
     - Provides meaningful API descriptions and examples
     - Handles breaking changes between versions

2. Dependency Injection and Services:
   - Create a project that demonstrates:
     - Proper service registration and lifetimes
     - Implementation of custom services and interfaces
     - Scoped vs. Transient vs. Singleton services
     - Unit testing with dependency injection

3. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Enhance your API with:
     - Global exception handling middleware
     - Structured logging with Serilog or NLog
     - Detailed but secure error responses
     - Health checks and monitoring endpoints

### Code Samples

You'll find the following examples in the subdirectories:
- `JwtAuthDemo/`: JWT authentication implementation
- `IdentityExample/`: ASP.NET Core Identity setup
- `ApiVersioning/`: API versioning and Swagger integration
- `DependencyInjectionDemo/`: Examples of DI patterns and usage
- `ErrorHandlingExample/`: Global error handling and logging

### Reflection Questions

1. How does proper authentication and authorization enhance API security?
2. What are the benefits of dependency injection for application architecture?
3. How does API versioning help manage changes over time?
