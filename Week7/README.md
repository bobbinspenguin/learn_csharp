# Week 7: Security and Authentication ✅ Complete

This week contains **1 comprehensive security-focused project** that demonstrates enterprise-level authentication and security practices.

## Sample Project Overview

### SecureAuthDemo - Complete Authentication and Security System
**Location**: `Week7/SecureAuthDemo/`

**Key Features**:
- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Token implementation with refresh tokens
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Admin, Manager, User roles with permissions
- **Password Security**: BCrypt hashing with salt for secure password storage
- **User Management**: Complete user registration, login, and profile management
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for all system activities
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks
- **Security Headers**: HTTPS, HSTS, CSP, and other security headers
- **Token Management**: JWT token generation, validation, and refresh
- **Password Policies**: Enforced password complexity and expiration
- **Account Lockout**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Security Middleware**: Custom security middleware for request validation
- **CORS Configuration**: Secure cross-origin resource sharing
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization and validation
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and EF Core protection
- **XSS Protection**: Cross-site scripting prevention measures

**Security Features**:
- **Registration**: Secure user registration with email validation
- **Login**: Multi-factor authentication support
- **Password Reset**: Secure password reset with time-limited tokens
- **Profile Management**: Secure profile updates with authorization
- **Admin Dashboard**: Administrative functions with proper authorization
- **Audit Reports**: Security audit reporting and monitoring
- **Token Blacklisting**: JWT token revocation support

**API Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login with JWT token
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Token refresh
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Secure logout
- `GET /api/auth/profile` - Get user profile (authenticated)
- `PUT /api/auth/profile` - Update user profile (authenticated)
- `GET /api/admin/users` - Admin: List all users
- `GET /api/admin/audit` - Admin: View audit logs
- `POST /api/admin/roles` - Admin: Manage user roles

**Run**: `cd Week7/SecureAuthDemo && dotnet run`

**Access Swagger UI**: Navigate to `https://localhost:7xxx/swagger` for API testing

### Hands-on Tasks

1. API Versioning and Documentation:
   - Create an API that:
     - Implements proper versioning (URL, header, or query parameter-based)
     - Uses Swagger/OpenAPI for documentation
     - Provides meaningful API descriptions and examples
     - Handles breaking changes between versions

2. Dependency Injection and Services:
   - Create a project that demonstrates:
     - Proper service registration and lifetimes
     - Implementation of custom services and interfaces
     - Scoped vs. Transient vs. Singleton services
     - Unit testing with dependency injection

3. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Enhance your API with:
     - Global exception handling middleware
     - Structured logging with Serilog or NLog
     - Detailed but secure error responses
     - Health checks and monitoring endpoints

### Code Samples

You'll find the following examples in the subdirectories:
- `JwtAuthDemo/`: JWT authentication implementation
- `IdentityExample/`: ASP.NET Core Identity setup
- `ApiVersioning/`: API versioning and Swagger integration
- `DependencyInjectionDemo/`: Examples of DI patterns and usage
- `ErrorHandlingExample/`: Global error handling and logging

### Reflection Questions

1. How does proper authentication and authorization enhance API security?
2. What are the benefits of dependency injection for application architecture?
3. How does API versioning help manage changes over time?
