## Day 2: Final Project Implementation

### Learning Objectives

- Build a complete application applying best practices
- Test and debug your application thoroughly
- Document your code and architecture decisions

### Resources

- [Testing in .NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/)
- [Debugging in Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/debugger-feature-tour)
- [Code Documentation Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/)

### Hands-on Tasks

1. Core Implementation:
   - Implement the core functionality of your application
   - Create the necessary models, controllers, and services
