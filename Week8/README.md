### Hands-on Tasks

1. Project Requirements:
   - Define the requirements for your final project
   - Choose between an API or Azure Functions approach
   - Identify the key features and functionality
   - Create user stories or feature descriptions

2. Architecture Design:
   - Design the architecture for your application
   - Plan the database schema and entity relationships
   - Identify external services or APIs to integrate with
   - Create a high-level diagram of your application components

3. Repository Setup:
   - Create a Git repository for your project
   - Set up the project structure and initial files
   - Configure the .gitignore file appropriately
   - Make your initial commit with the basic project structure

## Day 2: Final Project Implementation

### Learning Objectives

- Build a complete application applying best practices
- Test and debug your application thoroughly
- Document your code and architecture decisions

### Resources

- [Testing in .NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/)
- [Debugging in Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/debugger-feature-tour)
- [Code Documentation Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/)

### Hands-on Tasks

1. Core Implementation:
   - Implement the core functionality of your application
   - Create the necessary models, controllers, and services
   - Set up the database and implement data access
   - Ensure proper error handling and logging

2. Advanced Features:
   - Add authentication and authorization if applicable
   - Implement API versioning and documentation
   - Add performance optimizations where needed
   - Implement any special features unique to your project

3. Testing and Documentation:
   - Write unit tests for critical components
   - Perform manual testing of all features
   - Document your API endpoints or function triggers
   - Create a README file with setup and usage instructions

### Final Project Ideas

Here are some project ideas to consider:

1. **Task Management API**:
   - User authentication and task ownership
   - CRUD operations for tasks and task lists
   - Features like due dates, priorities, and categories
   - Notifications or reminders via email (optional)

2. **Blog Platform Backend**:
   - User authentication for authors and readers
   - CRUD operations for posts, comments, and categories
   - Features like drafts, publishing, and moderation
   - Media uploads and management (optional)

3. **E-commerce API**:
   - Product catalog with categories and search
   - Shopping cart functionality
   - Order processing and status tracking
   - User accounts and order history

4. **Weather Data Processing**:
   - Azure Functions to process weather data
   - Integration with external weather APIs
   - Data aggregation and statistical analysis
   - Scheduled data collection and reporting

5. **Personal Finance Tracker**:
   - User accounts and authentication
   - Transaction tracking and categorization
   - Budget planning and reporting
   - Data visualization for spending patterns

### Reflection Questions

1. What were the most valuable concepts you learned during this course?
2. What challenges did you face when implementing your final project?
3. How would you improve your project if you had more time?
4. What areas of C# and .NET would you like to explore further?
