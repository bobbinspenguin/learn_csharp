# Objective
I want to learn dotnet and C# programming language. I have two days of learning time per week, and I want to use this time effectively. I have a basic understanding of programming concepts but no prior experience with C# or .NET. My development environment will be Visual Studio Community Edition on Windows 11, and I want to focus on building APIs and Azure Functions. I would like to have a structured learning plan that spans over two months, with each week dedicated to specific topics and practical exercises.

- Create a program that reads data from a file, processes it, and writes the output to another file
## Week 4: Advanced C# Features
### Day 1: LINQ and Lambda Expressions
- Learn about LINQ (Language Integrated Query) and how to use it with collections
- Understand lambda expressions and how they simplify code
- Practice writing LINQ queries to filter and manipulate data
### Day 2: Asynchronous Programming

- Understand routing and controllers/triggers in APIs
## Week 6: Data Access and Entity Framework Core
### Day 1: Entity Framework Core
- Learn about Entity Framework Core and its role in data access
- Understand how to create a database context and perform CRUD operations
- Create a simple application that uses Entity Framework Core to interact with a database
### Day 2: Working with APIs and Data
- Connect your API or Azure Function to a database
- Implement CRUD operations via API endpoints or function triggers
- Practice returning and accepting data in JSON format
## Week 7: Security and Advanced API Features
### Day 1: Authentication and Authorization
- Learn about authentication and authorization for APIs
- Understand how to secure APIs using tokens (e.g., JWT)
- Practice creating a secure API with user authentication
### Day 2: Advanced API Concepts

- Explore dependency injection and configuration in .NET Core
- Practice building robust and maintainable APIs
## Week 8: Final Project and Review
### Day 1: Final Project Planning
- Choose a project that incorporates the concepts learned throughout the course (e.g., a backend API or Azure Function app)
- Plan the architecture and features of your project
- Set up a Git repository for version control
### Day 2: Final Project Implementation
